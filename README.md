# EV Car Battery Consumption Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting EV car battery consumption using a Machine Learning model. The model is trained to estimate battery usage based on various driving and environmental factors. The goal is to optimize EV trip planning and charging efficiency.

## Features
- **Trained Model**: The model has already been trained and is ready for use.
- **Training Script**: If you want to train the model from scratch, a training script is included.
- **Testing Script**: A testing script is available to validate the model's predictions.
- **Dataset Handling**: The project includes data preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy.
- **Optimization**: The model is optimized for real-world scenarios, ensuring reliable battery consumption predictions.

## How to Use
### Running the Pre-Trained Model
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the model inference script to get battery consumption predictions.

### Training the Model
If you wish to train the model from scratch:
1. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted.
2. Run the training script `train_model.py`.
3. The trained model will be saved for future use.

### Testing the Model
To validate the model's performance:
1. Run the testing script `test_model.py`.
2. The script will generate performance metrics and accuracy scores.

## Dependencies
